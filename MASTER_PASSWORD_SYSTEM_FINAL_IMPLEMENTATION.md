# Master Password System - FINAL IMPLEMENTATION

## Overview
Successfully implemented a master password system that allows salespersons to log into any customer account using a master override password.

## Database Setup - COMPLETE âœ…
- Created `PWD` table with master password: "Music123"
- Table structure verified and contains the correct master password

## Edge Function Implementation - COMPLETE âœ…
- Created `authenticate-with-master-password` edge function
- Function handles both regular authentication and master password fallback
- Logic implemented for account lookup by account number or email

## CRITICAL ISSUE - JWT VERIFICATION STILL ENABLED ðŸš¨

The function is deployed but JWT verification is still enabled, causing 404/401 errors.

### To Fix This Issue:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ekklokrukxmqlahtonnc
2. Navigate to Edge Functions
3. Find "authenticate-with-master-password" function
4. Go to Settings/Configuration
5. **DISABLE** "Verify JWT with legacy secret"
6. Save changes

### Function Logic Flow:
1. **Step 1**: Try regular authentication first
   - Query `accounts_lcmd` table for account by number or email
   - Check if provided password matches account password
   - If successful, return account data with `loginType: 'regular'`

2. **Step 2**: If regular auth fails, try master password
   - Query `PWD` table for master password
   - Compare provided password with master password
   - If match, verify account exists
   - Return account data with `loginType: 'master_password'`

### Test Command:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File test_master_password_simple.ps1
```

### Expected Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "account": {
    "account_number": 999,
    "acct_name": "...",
    "loginType": "master_password"
  }
}
```

## Frontend Integration - READY FOR TESTING
- Login components already support the new authentication endpoint
- Master Password tab in admin panel ready for password management

## NEXT STEPS:
1. **MANUALLY DISABLE JWT VERIFICATION** in Supabase dashboard
2. Test master password authentication
3. Integrate with frontend login system
4. Provide user training on master password usage

## Security Considerations:
- Master password stored in separate `PWD` table
- Function first attempts regular authentication before master password
- Master password access clearly logged with `loginType: 'master_password'`
- Only works for existing accounts in the system
