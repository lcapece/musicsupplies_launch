# Password Reset - Click Tracking Fix Applied

## The Problem
- You WERE receiving password reset emails ✅
- But clicking the reset button led to a non-existent domain: `email1.mg.musicsupplies.com`
- This was caused by Mailgun's click tracking feature rewriting your URLs

## The Solution
I've disabled Mailgun's click tracking in the edge function by changing:
```typescript
// Before (causing the issue)
formData.append('o:tracking-clicks', 'true')

// After (fixed)
formData.append('o:tracking-clicks', 'false')
```

## Status: FIXED ✅
The edge function has been successfully deployed with this fix.

## Next Steps

1. **Try password reset again** - The emails will now contain direct links that work properly
2. **Previous emails won't work** - Any password reset emails sent before this fix will still have broken links
3. **Request a new password reset** if needed

## Manual Reset Link (if needed)
If you need to reset your password immediately, use this link (valid for ~40 minutes):
```
http://localhost:5173/update-password?token=63f90cc4-76b3-45a8-b837-4b89b56e5807
```

## What This Means
- Password reset emails will now work correctly
- Links in emails will go directly to your app, not through Mailgun tracking
- You won't have analytics on email clicks, but the functionality will work properly

The password reset system is now fully functional!
