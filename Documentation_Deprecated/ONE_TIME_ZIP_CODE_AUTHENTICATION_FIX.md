# One-Time Zip Code Authentication Security Fix

## Problem Solved
The zip code authentication was designed to be a one-time initial password, but previously it could be reused multiple times. This created a security vulnerability where users could continue using their zip code even after setting a proper password.

## Solution Implemented
Added a new security mechanism that ensures the zip code can only be used once per account:

### Database Changes
1. **New Column**: Added `initial_password_used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE` to `accounts_lcmd` table
2. **Existing Account Migration**: Automatically marked accounts with existing passwords as having used their initial password
3. **Updated Authentication Function**: Modified `authenticate_user_lcmd` to enforce one-time usage

### Security Logic
```sql
-- Only allow zip code authentication if it has NEVER been used before
IF v_initial_password_used = true THEN
    -- Authentication fails - zip code already used
    RETURN failure;
END IF;

-- If zip code matches and hasn't been used:
IF v_default_password = LOWER(p_password) THEN
    -- Mark as used so it can never be used again
    UPDATE accounts_lcmd 
    SET initial_password_used = true 
    WHERE accounts_lcmd.account_number = v_account_number;
    
    -- Allow login with password change required
    RETURN success with requires_password_change = true;
END IF;
```

## Test Results - Account 117 (Lockport Music Center, Zip: 14094)

### ✅ Test 1: First-time zip code usage
- **Input**: Account 117, Password "14094"
- **Result**: SUCCESS
- **Debug**: "Default password MATCHES! Marking as used."
- **Behavior**: `requires_password_change: true` (triggers password change modal)
- **Database**: `initial_password_used` set to `true`

### ✅ Test 2: Attempting to reuse zip code
- **Input**: Account 117, Password "14094" (same as before)
- **Result**: FAILURE
- **Debug**: "Initial password (zip code) was already used. Authentication failed."
- **Behavior**: Authentication completely blocked
- **Security**: Zip code can never be used again

## Benefits
1. **Enhanced Security**: Zip code can only be used once, preventing ongoing unauthorized access
2. **Proper Initial Setup**: Forces users to set a real password after first login
3. **Permanent Protection**: Even if passwords are reset, zip code remains permanently blocked
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing accounts with passwords are automatically protected

## Implementation Details
- **Migration Applied**: `fix_one_time_zip_authentication` 
- **Function Updated**: `authenticate_user_lcmd`
- **Column Added**: `accounts_lcmd.initial_password_used`
- **Security Level**: High - one-time use enforcement

The zip code authentication now works exactly as intended: a secure one-time initial password that provides reasonable security for account setup while preventing reuse.
