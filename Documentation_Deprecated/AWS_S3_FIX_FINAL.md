# AWS S3 Edge Function - Final Fix

## Issue
The edge function was deployed before the AWS credentials were added to the vault, so it didn't have access to them.

## Solution Applied
1. ✅ Redeployed the edge function to pick up the vault secrets
2. ❌ Still need to add AWS_REGION to vault

## Final Step Required
Add the AWS_REGION to your Supabase Vault:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ekklokrukxmqlahtonnc/settings/vault
2. Click "New secret"
3. Add:
   - Name: `AWS_REGION`
   - Value: `us-east-1`

## What Happens Next
Once AWS_REGION is added, the "Create source files" button will immediately start working and fetch your REAL S3 files from bucket mus86077.

The edge function will use:
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID (✅ already in vault)
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (✅ already in vault)  
- AWS_REGION (❌ needs to be added)

No more redeployment needed - just add that one secret and it will work!
