# Shipping Address Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the "Shipping Address is Different than Bill-To Address" functionality in the shopping cart checkout process.

## Database Changes
- **Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20250730_add_shipping_address_fields.sql`
- **New Fields Added to `web_orders` table**:
  - `shipped_to_address` (TEXT)
  - `shipped_to_city` (TEXT)
  - `shipped_to_state` (TEXT)
  - `shipped_to_zip` (TEXT)
  - `shipped_to_phone` (TEXT)
  - `shipped_to_contact_name` (TEXT)

## Frontend Changes

### 1. CartContext Updates (`src/context/CartContext.tsx`)
- Added `ShippingAddress` interface with:
  - `shippingDifferent`: boolean
  - `shippingAddress`: string (optional)
  - `shippingCity`: string (optional)
  - `shippingState`: string (optional)
  - `shippingZip`: string (optional)
  - `shippingPhone`: string (optional)
  - `shippingContactName`: string (optional)
- Updated `placeOrder` function signature to accept shipping address data
- Modified order payload to include shipping fields when checkbox is checked

### 2. ShoppingCart Component Updates (`src/components/ShoppingCart.tsx`)
- Added state variables for all shipping address fields
- Added checkbox: "Shipping Address is Different than Bill-To Address"
- Created conditional shipping address form section that appears when checkbox is checked
- Shipping address form includes:
  - Contact Name
  - Street Address
  - City
  - State
  - ZIP Code
  - Phone Number (with formatting)
- Updated `handlePlaceOrder` to pass shipping data to the cart context

## User Experience
1. During checkout, users see a checkbox labeled "Shipping Address is Different than Bill-To Address"
2. When checked, a form section appears with all shipping address fields
3. Phone number formatting is applied automatically
4. When order is placed, shipping address data is saved to the database only if the checkbox was checked
5. The shipping address data is stored in the database with "shipped_to_" prefixed fields

## Technical Implementation Details
- Uses conditional rendering to show/hide shipping address fields
- Reuses the existing phone number formatting function for shipping phone
- Shipping address data is only included in the database if `shippingDifferent` is true
- All shipping address fields are optional (no validation required)
- Background styling (gray background) differentiates the shipping section from bill-to fields

## Testing
The implementation is ready for testing. Users can:
1. Add items to cart
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Check the "Shipping Address is Different than Bill-To Address" checkbox
4. Fill in the shipping address fields
5. Complete the order
6. Verify shipping address data is saved in the web_orders table

## Database Field Mapping
- UI Field → Database Column
- Contact Name → `shipped_to_contact_name`
- Street Address → `shipped_to_address`
- City → `shipped_to_city`
- State → `shipped_to_state`
- ZIP Code → `shipped_to_zip`
- Phone Number → `shipped_to_phone`

The implementation follows the existing code patterns and maintains consistency with the current checkout flow.
