## üõ† Technical Implementation

### Component Architecture
```typescript
interface QuantitySelectorProps {
  product: ProductInfo;           // Product data with inventory
  onAddToCart: CartFunction;      // Callback for cart operations  
  disabled?: boolean;             // External disable state
  isAdding?: boolean;            // Loading state indicator
  fontSize?: FontSize;           // Responsive font sizing
}
```

### State Management
- **Local State**: Quantity, validation errors, UI states
- **External State**: Cart operations, inventory data
- **Derived State**: Validation results, display states
- **Synchronized State**: Maintains consistency with parent components

### Integration Pattern
```typescript
<QuantitySelector
  product={product}
  onAddToCart={handleAddToCart}
  disabled={!isCartReady}
  isAdding={addingToCart === product.partnumber}
  fontSize={fontSize}
/>
```

### Validation Logic
1. **Input Validation**: Numbers only, positive integers
2. **Range Validation**: Between 1 and maximum inventory
