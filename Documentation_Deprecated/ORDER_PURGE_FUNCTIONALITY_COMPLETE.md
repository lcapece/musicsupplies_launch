# Order Purge Functionality Implementation - Complete

## Feature Overview
Added a "Purge Order" button to the Admin Order History tab that allows permanent deletion of cancelled orders from the system.

## Requirements Fulfilled
✅ Show "Purge Order" button only for orders with status "Canceled"  
✅ Display confirmation dialog with specific order number  
✅ Permanently delete the order from the database  
✅ Refresh the order list after successful purge  
✅ Handle related data cleanup (promo code usage records)  

## Technical Implementation

### 1. New State Management
Added `purgingOrder` state to track which order is currently being processed:
```typescript
const [purgingOrder, setPurgingOrder] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

### 2. Purge Order Handler
Implemented `handlePurgeOrder` function with the following features:

**Confirmation Dialog:**
```typescript
if (!confirm(`Are you sure you want to permanently delete order number ${order.order_number}? This action cannot be undone and will completely remove the order from the system.`)) {
  return;
}
```

**Data Cleanup Process:**
1. Delete related promo code usage records first
2. Permanently delete the order from `web_orders` table
3. Remove order from local state immediately (optimistic update)
4. Refresh the complete order list from database
5. Show success confirmation

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful handling of promo code cleanup failures
- Database refresh on errors to maintain consistency
- User-friendly error messages

### 3. UI Implementation
**Button Visibility Logic:**
```typescript
{order.order_status === 'Canceled' && (
  <button
    onClick={() => handlePurgeOrder(order)}
    disabled={purgingOrder === order.id}
    className="text-red-800 hover:text-red-900 font-medium disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed bg-red-50 hover:bg-red-100 px-2 py-1 rounded"
  >
    {purgingOrder === order.id ? 'Purging...' : 'Purge Order'}
  </button>
)}
```

**Visual Design:**
- Red color scheme to indicate destructive action
- Background highlight on hover for better visibility
- Loading state with "Purging..." text
- Disabled state during operation to prevent double-clicks

### 4. Database Operations
The purge operation performs the following database actions:

1. **Cleanup Related Data:**
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM promo_code_usage WHERE order_id = ?
   ```

2. **Delete Main Order:**
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM web_orders WHERE id = ?
   ```

3. **State Management:**
   - Immediate local state update for responsive UI
   - Database refresh for data consistency

## User Experience Flow

1. **View Orders:** Admin sees list of all orders in Order History tab
2. **Identify Cancelled Orders:** Orders with "Canceled" status show red badge
3. **Purge Access:** "Purge Order" button appears only for cancelled orders
4. **Confirmation:** Click triggers confirmation dialog with order number
5. **Processing:** Button shows "Purging..." state during operation
6. **Completion:** Success message shown, order removed from list
7. **Consistency:** List automatically refreshes to show updated data

## Security & Safety Features

- **Double Confirmation:** Explicit confirmation dialog with order number
- **Status Restriction:** Only cancelled orders can be purged
- **Clear Messaging:** Warning about permanent deletion and data loss
- **Error Recovery:** Database refresh on failures maintains data integrity
- **Visual Cues:** Distinctive red styling indicates destructive action
