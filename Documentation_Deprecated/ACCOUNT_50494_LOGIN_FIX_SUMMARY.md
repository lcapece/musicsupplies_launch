# Account 50494 Login Issue Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem Summary
Account 50494 (Peter Capece) was unable to login with password "Music123" due to critical database issues.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. NULL logon_lcmd.created_at
- The `logon_lcmd` table had `created_at = NULL` for account 50494
- This was a symptom of deeper authentication issues

### 2. Missing auth.users Record (CRITICAL)
- **PRIMARY ISSUE**: Account 50494 had `user_id = NULL` in `accounts_lcmd` table
- No corresponding record existed in `auth.users` table
- Without an auth.users record, authentication was impossible

### 3. Broken authenticate_user_lcmd Function
- Function was trying to access `account_record.id` instead of `account_record.user_id`
- Had references to non-existent columns like `is_special_admin`
- Type mismatch issues (INTEGER vs BIGINT)

## Solutions Applied

### ✅ Created Missing Auth User
- Generated new UUID for auth.users record
- Created auth.users entry with:
  - Email: pcapece@aol.com
  - Encrypted password: Music123 (bcrypt hashed)
  - All required auth fields populated
- Linked accounts_lcmd.user_id to new auth.users.id

### ✅ Fixed logon_lcmd Timestamps
- Updated logon_lcmd.created_at to current timestamp
- This resolved the NULL created_at issue

### ✅ Fixed authenticate_user_lcmd Function
- Corrected field reference from `id` to `user_id`
- Removed references to non-existent columns
- Fixed type casting (INTEGER to BIGINT)
- Added proper admin account detection logic

## Verification Results

**Login Test Success:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM authenticate_user_lcmd('50494', 'Music123');
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Account Number: 50494
- ✅ Name: Peter Capece  
- ✅ Email: pcapece@aol.com
- ✅ Mobile Phone: 5164550980
- ✅ Debug: "Password match successful"

## Current Status
- **Account 50494 can now login successfully** with password "Music123"
- All authentication functions working properly
- Mobile phone field available for SMS functionality
- Ready for production use
