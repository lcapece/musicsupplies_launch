e# Netlify Deployment Fix for SPA Routing Issue

## Problem Identified
- URL showing `/spa-website.html` instead of proper React Router paths
- Random Netlify subdomain: `fastidious-wisp-364fa5.netlify.app`
- "Page not found" error on deployment

## Root Cause
The issue is likely caused by:
1. Old deployment cache or configuration
2. Random Netlify site name assignment
3. Possible browser cache of old deployment

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated netlify.toml Configuration
- Added proper redirect rules in netlify.toml
- Added security headers and caching rules
- Configured build contexts for different environments

### 2. Verified Build Configuration
- ✅ `_redirects` file exists in `public/` directory with correct SPA redirect rule: `/* /index.html 200`
- ✅ Build successfully creates `dist/` folder with proper structure
- ✅ `dist/index.html` exists and is correct
- ✅ `dist/_redirects` file is copied during build

### 3. Build Verification
- Build completed successfully with no errors
- All assets properly generated in `dist/` folder
- No references to "spa-website.html" found in codebase

## Next Steps to Fix Deployment

### Option 1: Clear Netlify Cache and Redeploy
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Find your site (fastidious-wisp-364fa5)
3. Go to Site Settings > Build & Deploy
4. Click "Clear cache and deploy site"

### Option 2: Set Custom Site Name
1. In Netlify dashboard, go to Site Settings > General
2. Change site name from random name to something like "musicsupplies-app"
3. This will give you a URL like `musicsupplies-app.netlify.app`

### Option 3: Manual Redeploy
1. Delete the current site in Netlify
2. Create a new site and drag/drop the `dist/` folder
3. Or connect to your GitHub repo for automatic deployments

### Option 4: Use Netlify CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI if not already installed
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy from the project root
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

## Expected Result After Fix
- Site should load at root URL without `/spa-website.html`
- React Router should handle all client-side routing
- All routes should work properly (/, /admin, /login, etc.)
- Images should load correctly from S3 bucket `mus86077`

## Files Modified
- `netlify.toml` - Updated with proper configuration
- Build verified and working correctly

## Important Notes
- The build is working correctly - this is purely a deployment/routing issue
- Your React app and all configurations are correct
- The S3 bucket `mus86077` for images is properly configured
- Database fallback function has been updated to use only `products_supabase` table (no longer uses `rt_extended`)
- Fallback function returns "AGM" for Stadium Instrument Cases & Bags products
