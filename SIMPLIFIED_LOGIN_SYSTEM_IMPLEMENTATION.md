# Simplified Login/Password System Implementation

## Overview
A simplified authentication system has been implemented that replaces the complex Supabase Auth system with a straightforward account number + password approach.

## Key Features

### 1. Default Password Generation
- **Formula**: First letter of company name (uppercase) + 5-digit ZIP code
- **Example**: For "Lou Capece Music" with ZIP "11554" → Default password: "L11554"
- **Function**: `get_default_password(account_number)`

### 2. Two-Phase Authentication Process

#### Phase 1: First-Time Login (Default Password)
- User enters account number and default password
- System detects no custom password set
- Prompts user to create a new password
- **Requirements for new password**:
  - Minimum 6 characters
  - Must contain at least 1 number
  - Cannot be the same as default password

#### Phase 2: Standard Login (Custom Password)
- User enters account number and their custom password
- System authenticates against stored password in `logon_lcmd` table
- Returns user information and admin status

### 3. Database Functions

#### `authenticate_user_simplified(account_num, provided_password)`
- Main authentication function
- Handles both default and custom password scenarios
- Returns JSON response with:
  - `success`: boolean
  - `requires_password_setup`: boolean (for first-time users)
  - `account_number`, `account_name`: user details
  - `is_special_admin`: true for account 999
  - `debug_info`: detailed logging information

#### `setup_user_password(account_num, new_password)`
- Sets up custom password for first-time users
- Validates password requirements
- Stores password in `logon_lcmd` table
- Marks password as non-default

### 4. Enhanced logon_lcmd Table
New columns added:
- `is_default_password`: boolean flag
- `updated_at`: timestamp of last update
- `password_set_date`: when password was set

### 5. RLS Policies for Account 999
Account 999 (Lou Capece Music) has been granted special admin privileges:
- **Full read/write access** to all rows in `accounts_lcmd` table
- **Full read/write access** to all rows in `logon_lcmd` table
- Can manage all customer accounts and passwords

### 6. Anonymous Access for Authentication
- Anonymous users can access authentication functions
- Required for login process to work before user is authenticated

## Testing Results

### Account 999 Authentication Test
```sql
SELECT authenticate_user_simplified(999, 'Music123');
```

**Result**: 
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "account_number": 999,
  "account_name": "Lou Capece Music", 
  "is_special_admin": true,
  "debug_info": "Account found: 999. Default password calculated. Logon record exists. Password match successful."
}
```

### Default Password Generation Test
```sql
SELECT get_default_password(999);
```

**Result**: `L11554` (L from "Lou Capece Music" + 11554 ZIP code)

## Implementation Status
✅ Database functions created and tested
✅ RLS policies implemented for account 999 admin access
✅ Anonymous access policies for authentication
✅ Password validation and setup functions
✅ First-time login detection and password setup flow

## Next Steps for Frontend Integration

1. **Update Login Component**
   - Call `authenticate_user_simplified()` function
   - Handle `requires_password_setup` response
   - Show password setup modal for first-time users

2. **Create Password Setup Modal**
   - Collect new password with validation
   - Call `setup_user_password()` function
   - Redirect to dashboard after successful setup

3. **Session Management**
   - Store account info in session/context
   - Use `is_special_admin` flag for admin features
   - Implement logout functionality

## Security Features
- Case-sensitive password storage and matching
- Password complexity requirements
- Default password cannot be reused as custom password  
- Audit trail with timestamps
- RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

## Admin Capabilities (Account 999)
- Full access to all customer accounts
- Can read/modify any account information
- Can reset passwords for any account
- Can access all login records
- Special `is_special_admin` flag for frontend admin features

The system is now ready for frontend integration and provides a much simpler authentication flow compared to the previous Supabase Auth implementation.
