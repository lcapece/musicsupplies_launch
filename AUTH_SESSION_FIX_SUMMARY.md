# Auth Session Missing Error - Fixed

## Problem
The account settings modal was showing "Auth session missing!" error when users tried to update their profile information. This was preventing users from updating their account details.

## Root Cause
The `AuthContext.tsx` had two functions declared in the `AuthContextType` interface but not implemented in the provider:
- `validateAndRefreshSession()`
- `ensureAuthSession()`

This caused authentication validation to fail when components tried to verify sessions before database operations.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Authentication Functions

**`validateAndRefreshSession()`**:
- Checks if user exists in context and sessionManager
- Verifies Supabase auth session validity
- Automatically refreshes expired sessions
- Validates/refreshes JWT claims for RLS policies
- Clears invalid sessions and updates context

**`ensureAuthSession()`**:
- First attempts to validate current session
- If validation fails, tries to restore from sessionManager
- Sets JWT claims for restored sessions
- Updates authentication context state
- Provides clear error messages for failures

### 2. Updated AccountSettingsModal

Added session validation to `handleProfileUpdate()`:
- Calls `ensureAuthSession()` before any database operations
- Shows clear error message if session validation fails
- Prevents "Auth session missing!" errors

### 3. Enhanced Session Management

- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Automatic session recovery when possible  
- Consistent state between sessionManager and Supabase auth
- JWT claims validation for database access

## Files Modified

1. **`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`**:
   - Added `validateAndRefreshSession()` function implementation
   - Added `ensureAuthSession()` function implementation
   - Added functions to AuthContext.Provider value

2. **`src/components/AccountSettingsModal.tsx`**:
   - Added `ensureAuthSession` to useAuth destructuring
   - Added session validation before profile updates
   - Enhanced error handling for auth failures

## Result

- ✅ "Auth session missing!" error is now resolved
- ✅ Users can successfully update their profile information
- ✅ Proper session validation before database operations
- ✅ Automatic session refresh when needed
- ✅ Clear error messages for authentication issues
- ✅ Improved session management and recovery

## Testing

The fix ensures that:
1. Sessions are validated before any profile updates
2. Expired sessions are automatically refreshed when possible
3. Invalid sessions trigger proper error messages
4. JWT claims are maintained for database access
5. Session state remains consistent across the application

This resolves the authentication error and provides a more robust session management system.
