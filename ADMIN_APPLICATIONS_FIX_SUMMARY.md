# Admin Account Applications - "No Applications Found" Fix Summary

## Issue
The Admin Backend (Account 999) was showing "No applications found" in the Account Applications page, even though there were 2 pending applications in the database.

## Root Cause
The authentication system used a custom PL/pgSQL function (`authenticate_user_lcmd`) but didn't create proper Supabase Auth JWT tokens with the required claims for Row Level Security (RLS) policies. The RLS policies expected:
- `auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin'` for admin access
- `auth.jwt() ->> 'account_number' = '999'` for account 999 access

But `auth.jwt()` was returning `null` because no proper JWT session was established.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Functions
Created new functions to handle custom JWT claims:
- `set_admin_jwt_claims(p_account_number)` - Sets session-based claims for admin access
- `get_current_jwt_claims()` - Retrieves current custom claims

### 2. Updated RLS Policies
Modified the `account_applications` table policies to check both:
- Standard Supabase Auth JWT (`auth.jwt()`)
- Custom claims as fallback (`get_current_jwt_claims()`)

New unified policies:
- `"Enable admin and account 999 read access"` - For SELECT operations
- `"Enable admin and account 999 update access"` - For UPDATE operations

### 3. Frontend Authentication Updates
Updated `AuthContext.tsx` to:
- Call `set_admin_jwt_claims()` during login to establish proper session claims
- Restore claims during session restoration (page reload)
- Handle errors gracefully without breaking the login flow

## Files Modified
1. **Database Migration**: `fix_admin_applications_auth`
   - Added JWT claims functions
   - Updated RLS policies

2. **Frontend**: `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`
   - Added JWT claims setting in login process
   - Added JWT claims restoration in session loading

## Verification
✅ Account applications are now visible in the admin backend
✅ RLS policies work correctly with both standard and custom JWT claims
✅ Applications show correct data:
   - "http://dataautomation.ai 33" (submitted 2025-07-23 18:28:44)
   - "http://dataautomation.ai" (submitted 2025-07-23 16:07:37)
   - Both with status "pending"

## Technical Details
- **Account 999**: "Lou Capece Music" - Admin account
- **Application Data**: 2 pending applications from Louis Capece
- **Authentication Flow**: Custom PL/pgSQL → Session Claims → RLS Policy Check
- **Fallback System**: Uses both `auth.jwt()` and custom claims for maximum compatibility

## Next Steps
- Admin can now view, review, and manage account applications
- System supports both standard Supabase Auth and custom authentication flows
- RLS policies ensure data security while allowing proper admin access
