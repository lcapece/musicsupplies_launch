/*
  # Fix password authentication for case-insensitive default passwords
  
  This migration addresses the issue with account 101's password "A11803" not being accepted.
  The key changes are:
  
  1. Simplify the authentication function to focus on two clear paths:
     - Direct password match from accounts_lcmd.password (case-sensitive)
     - Default password pattern match (case-insensitive)
  
  2. Ensure account 101 has the correct password in the database
  
  3. Add detailed logging to help diagnose authentication issues
