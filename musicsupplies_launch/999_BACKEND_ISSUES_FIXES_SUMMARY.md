# 999 Backend Issues - Fixed

## Issue 1: SMS Notification Panel - Multiple Admin Phone Numbers

### Problem
The SMS notification system only supported one admin phone number per event. Need support for up to 3 admin phone numbers.

### Solution Implemented

#### Database Changes
1. **Added new column to `sms_notification_settings` table:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE sms_notification_settings 
   ADD COLUMN notification_phones TEXT[] DEFAULT ARRAY[]::TEXT[];
   ```

2. **Migrated existing data:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE sms_notification_settings 
   SET notification_phones = ARRAY[notification_phone]
   WHERE notification_phone IS NOT NULL AND notification_phone != '';
   ```

3. **Added constraint to limit to 3 phone numbers:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE sms_notification_settings 
   ADD CONSTRAINT max_three_phones 
   CHECK (array_length(notification_phones, 1) <= 3);
   ```

#### New Edge Function
- **Created:** `supabase/functions/send-admin-sms/index.ts`
- **Purpose:** Send SMS notifications to multiple admin phone numbers
- **Features:**
  - Fetches all configured phone numbers for an event
  - Sends SMS to all numbers simultaneously
  - Returns detailed results for each phone number
  - Handles failures gracefully

#### Frontend Updates
- **Updated:** `src/components/admin/SmsNotificationTab.tsx`
- **Changes:**
  - Added support for 3 phone number input fields
  - Updated interface to include `notification_phones` array
  - Modified test SMS functionality to use new Edge Function
  - Updated UI to show phone count and status

### Testing
- Edge Function deployed successfully (ID: f03dd015-0f4d-49c0-9d73-32131b9140b8)
- Database migration completed without errors
- UI now shows 3 phone input fields for each event

## Issue 2: Account Applications Not Showing

### Problem
The "Applications" page was not showing new applicants due to incorrect RLS (Row Level Security) policies.

### Root Cause Analysis
The RLS policies were checking for `auth.jwt() ->> 'role' = 'admin'`, but this system uses account-based authentication where account 999 is the admin account.

### Solution Implemented

#### Fixed RLS Policies
```sql
-- Removed old policies that looked for JWT roles
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for admins" ON account_applications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable update access for admins" ON account_applications;

-- Added new policies for account 999 (admin account)
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for account 999" ON account_applications
  FOR SELECT USING (
    (auth.jwt() ->> 'account_number')::integer = 999
  );

CREATE POLICY "Enable update access for account 999" ON account_applications
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    (auth.jwt() ->> 'account_number')::integer = 999
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    (auth.jwt() ->> 'account_number')::integer = 999
  );

-- Added fallback policies for JWT role-based admin access
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for admin role" ON account_applications
  FOR SELECT USING (
    (auth.jwt() ->> 'role') = 'admin'
  );

CREATE POLICY "Enable update access for admin role" ON account_applications
  FOR UPDATE USING (
    (auth.jwt() ->> 'role') = 'admin'
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    (auth.jwt() ->> 'role') = 'admin'
  );
```

### Verification
- Confirmed account 999 exists: "Lou Capece Music"
- Found existing account application in database (created: 2025-07-23 16:07:37)
- RLS policies now properly allow account 999 to view applications

## Next Steps

1. **Test SMS Functionality:**

   - Test SMS notifications for both "order_entered" and "new_account_application" events

2. **Verify Account Applications:**
   - Login as account 999 and navigate to Applications page
   - Confirm that existing applications are now visible
   - Test creating new applications to ensure they appear

3. **Configure ClickSend Environment Variables:**
