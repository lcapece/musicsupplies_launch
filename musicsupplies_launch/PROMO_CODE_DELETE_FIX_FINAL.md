# Promo Code Delete Fix - Final Solution

## 🔍 **Root Cause Identified**
The console logs revealed that the user was showing as "No user" in Supabase Auth, even though the delete function was working correctly. The issue was that the application uses a **custom authentication system** (not Supabase Auth), but the delete function was trying to use Supabase Auth for RLS permissions.

## 🛠️ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Created Admin Delete Function**
Created a database function `admin_delete_promo_code()` that:
- Uses `SECURITY DEFINER` to bypass RLS policies
- Validates that only account 999 can delete promo codes
- Returns detailed success/error information
- Handles all edge cases and exceptions

### 2. **Updated Frontend Code**
Modified `PromoCodeManagementTab.tsx` to:
- Check authentication using localStorage (custom auth system)
- Validate user is account 999 before attempting deletion
- Call the new admin function instead of direct Supabase delete
- Provide comprehensive debugging logs

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Database Function
```sql
admin_delete_promo_code(p_promo_code_id UUID, p_account_number INTEGER)
```
- **SECURITY DEFINER**: Bypasses RLS policies
- **Account Validation**: Only allows account 999
- **Error Handling**: Returns JSON with success/error details

### Frontend Changes
- Uses `localStorage.getItem('user')` for authentication check
- Calls `supabase.rpc('admin_delete_promo_code', {...})`
- Validates account number is 999
- Enhanced error handling and logging

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

### **CRITICAL: User Must Be Logged In**
For the delete function to work, you must:

1. **Log in as account 999** using the application's login system
2. **Navigate to Admin Dashboard → Promo Codes**
3. **Try deleting a promo code**

### **Expected Console Output**
When properly logged in as account 999, you should see:
```
👤 Current user from localStorage: {
  accountNumber: "999",
  acctName: "Lou Capece Music",
  isSpecialAdmin: true
}
🔐 Calling admin_delete_promo_code function...
📊 Admin delete function result: { success: true, message: "Promo code deleted successfully" }
✅ DELETE OPERATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
```

## 🚨 **If Still Not Working**

1. **Check if logged in**: Look for user data in localStorage
2. **Verify account 999**: Ensure you're logged in as the correct account
3. **Check console logs**: Look for authentication errors
4. **Database verification**: Confirm account 999 exists and has proper user_id mapping

## 📋 **Files Modified**
- `src/components/admin/PromoCodeManagementTab.tsx` - Updated delete function
- Database: Added `admin_delete_promo_code()` function

The solution is now complete and should work once you're properly authenticated as account 999!
