### Task 2: Enhanced SMS Consent Modal ✅
Completely redesigned the SMS consent modal to meet ALL ClickSend TFN registration requirements:

## ✅ ClickSend Compliance Requirements Met

### Required Elements (All Implemented):
1. **✅ Brand Name**: "Lou Capece Music Distributors / MusicSupplies.com" prominently displayed
2. **✅ Clear SMS Statement**: "You are signing up to receive SMS text messages..."
3. **✅ Message Types**: Clearly separated transactional vs marketing messages
4. **✅ Message Frequency**: "Message frequency varies. You may receive 2-10 messages per month..."
5. **✅ Rate Disclosure**: "Message and data rates may apply"
6. **✅ Clickable Policy Links**: Links to Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy, SMS Policy
7. **✅ Help/Stop Instructions**: "Text HELP for help, STOP to unsubscribe"
8. **✅ Express Written Consent**: Separate checkbox for marketing (unchecked by default)

### Database Schema Updates:
- **New Field**: `marketing_sms_consent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE`
- **Separate Tracking**: Transactional consent vs marketing consent
- **Performance Indexes**: Added for consent queries

## Files Modified:

### Frontend Components:
1. **`src/components/SmsConsentModal.tsx`** - Completely rewritten with full compliance
2. **`src/pages/CustomerAccountPage.tsx`** - Integrated new modal with proper handlers
3. **`src/pages/PrivacyPolicyPage.tsx`** - Updated email addresses

### Database Migration:
4. **`supabase/migrations/20250714_add_marketing_sms_consent_field.sql`** - Ready to apply

## Manual Database Migration Required:

Run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard (SQL Editor):

```sql
-- Add marketing SMS consent field to accounts_lcmd table
-- This allows separate tracking of transactional vs marketing SMS consent
-- as required by ClickSend TFN registration compliance

ALTER TABLE accounts_lcmd 
ADD COLUMN marketing_sms_consent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- Add comment to explain the field
COMMENT ON COLUMN accounts_lcmd.marketing_sms_consent IS 'Tracks express written consent for marketing SMS messages, separate from transactional SMS consent';

-- Update existing records to have marketing consent false by default
UPDATE accounts_lcmd 
SET marketing_sms_consent = FALSE 
WHERE marketing_sms_consent IS NULL;

-- Add index for performance on consent queries
CREATE INDEX idx_accounts_lcmd_marketing_sms_consent ON accounts_lcmd(marketing_sms_consent);
CREATE INDEX idx_accounts_lcmd_sms_consents ON accounts_lcmd(sms_consent, marketing_sms_consent);
```

## How It Works:

1. **Account Page**: Users click "SMS Consent" button next to phone number field
2. **Compliance Modal**: Opens with all required ClickSend elements
3. **Dual Consent**: Users can consent to transactional only OR both transactional + marketing
4. **Database Storage**: Separate fields track each consent type
5. **Phone Number**: Can be entered in modal or account form (optional)
