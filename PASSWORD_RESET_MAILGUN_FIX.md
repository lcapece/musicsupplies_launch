# Password Reset Mailgun Integration Fix

## Issue Summary
The password reset functionality was failing silently after successfully:
1. Finding the user in the database
2. Creating a password reset token

The failure occurred at the email sending step via the Mailgun edge function.

## Root Cause
The edge function was looking for an environment variable named `MAILGUN_API_KEY`, but the actual Supabase secret is named `MAILGUN_SENDING_KEY`.

## Solution Implemented
Updated the `send-mailgun-email` edge function to use the correct environment variable name:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect):
const MAILGUN_API_KEY = Deno.env.get('MAILGUN_API_KEY')

// After (correct):
const MAILGUN_API_KEY = Deno.env.get('MAILGUN_SENDING_KEY')
```

## Testing Steps
1. Navigate to the login page
2. Click "Forgot Password?"
3. Enter a valid email address from the database
4. Click "Send Reset Link"
5. Check email for password reset link

## Edge Function Version
The fix was deployed as version 18 of the `send-mailgun-email` edge function.

## Additional Improvements
- Added better error logging to help diagnose configuration issues
- The function now logs available environment variables (filtered for MAILGUN) when configuration is missing
- Improved error messages for better debugging
