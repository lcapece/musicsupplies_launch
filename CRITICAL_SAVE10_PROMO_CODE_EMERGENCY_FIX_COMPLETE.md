# üö® CRITICAL SAVE10 PROMO CODE EMERGENCY FIX - COMPLETE

**Date:** August 8, 2025 09:10 AM  
**Status:** ‚úÖ EMERGENCY RESOLVED - ALL LIVE CUSTOMERS RESTORED

## üî• CRITICAL ISSUE SUMMARY

**Problem:** Multiple live customers were unable to use the SAVE10 promo code due to orphaned database records from purged orders. This was affecting real revenue and customer experience.

**Affected Customers:**
- Account 101 ‚úÖ FIXED
- Account 115 ‚úÖ FIXED  
- Account 119 ‚úÖ FIXED
- Account 3611 ‚úÖ FIXED
- Account 50455 ‚úÖ FIXED
- Account 50494 ‚úÖ FIXED

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

When orders were purged via the admin dashboard, the system correctly deleted the order records but **FAILED TO CLEAN UP** the corresponding `promo_code_usage` records. This left "ghost" usage records that blocked customers from using SAVE10 again.

**Technical Details:**
- Orphaned records had `order_id = NULL` (purged orders)
- But still contained `account_number` and `promo_code_id` 
- Single-use enforcement was triggered by these ghost records
- Prevented legitimate customers from using their first-time discount

## ‚ö° EMERGENCY ACTIONS TAKEN

### 1. **Immediate Customer Relief**
```sql
-- Deleted ALL orphaned promo code usage records
DELETE FROM promo_code_usage 
WHERE order_id IS NULL 
AND promo_code_id = '92babb8d-c9a4-4ac9-8138-90e3b34bb802';
```

### 2. **Verification Completed**
- ‚úÖ Confirmed 0 orphaned records remain
- ‚úÖ All 6 affected customers now free to use SAVE10
- ‚úÖ Promo code system fully restored
