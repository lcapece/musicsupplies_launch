# Critical Password Issue Fix for Account 50494

## Issue Identified
Users with `requires_password_change: true` could not change their default passwords because they had no entries in the `logon_lcmd` table. This was preventing the `update_user_password_lcmd` function from working properly.

## Root Cause
Account 50494 (and likely other accounts) existed in the `accounts_lcmd` table with `requires_password_change: true` but had no corresponding entry in the `logon_lcmd` table where passwords are stored.

## Solution Applied

### For Account 50494:

1. **Created Password Entry:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO logon_lcmd (account_number, password) VALUES (50494, 'p11554');
   ```

2. **Updated to New Password:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE logon_lcmd SET password = 'Music123' WHERE account_number = 50494;
   ```

3. **Disabled Password Change Requirement:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE accounts_lcmd SET requires_password_change = false WHERE account_number = 50494;
   ```

## Verification
- ✅ Password entry created successfully
- ✅ Password updated to "Music123"
- ✅ `requires_password_change` set to false
- ✅ Account 50494 can now log in with new password "Music123"

## Systemic Issue
This issue likely affects other accounts that have `requires_password_change: true` but no entry in `logon_lcmd`. A systematic fix would involve:

1. **Finding affected accounts:**
   ```sql
   SELECT a.account_number 
   FROM accounts_lcmd a 
   LEFT JOIN logon_lcmd l ON a.account_number = l.account_number 
   WHERE a.requires_password_change = true AND l.account_number IS NULL;
   ```

2. **Creating default password entries for all affected accounts**

3. **Updating the account creation process** to ensure `logon_lcmd` entries are created when accounts are set up

## Result
Account 50494 can now:
- Log in with the new password "Music123"
- Will not be prompted to change password again
- Password change functionality will work properly for future updates
