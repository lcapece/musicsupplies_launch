# 🛠️ ADMIN BACKEND CRITICAL FIXES

## 🚨 **ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**

### 1. **Set Password Feature Failing**
- **Error**: `new row violates row-level security policy for table "logon_lcmd"`
- **Cause**: RLS policies preventing admin (account 999) from inserting/updating password records
- **Impact**: Admin cannot set custom passwords for accounts

### 2. **Order History Not Loading**
- **Error**: Admin cannot access order history data
- **Cause**: RLS policies preventing admin access to `production_ordhist` table
- **Impact**: Order History tab shows no data

### 3. **New Account Application Failing**
- **Error**: `Could not find the 'other_retailer_type_description' column of 'account_applications' in the schema cache`
- **Cause**: Form trying to submit a field that doesn't exist in database table
- **Impact**: New account applications cannot be submitted

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**

### **SQL Fix File Created:** `fix_admin_rls_policies.sql`
### **Code Fix Applied:** `src/pages/NewAccountApplicationPage.tsx`

This comprehensive fix addresses Row Level Security (RLS) policies for three critical tables and fixes the application form submission:

#### **1. logon_lcmd Table (Password Management)**
- ✅ Admin accounts (999, 99) get full access
- ✅ Regular users can access/modify their own records
- ✅ Fixes "Set Password" functionality

#### **2. accounts_lcmd Table (Account Management)**  
- ✅ Admin accounts (999, 99) get full access
- ✅ Regular users can access/modify their own records
- ✅ Ensures account management works properly

#### **3. production_ordhist Table (Order History)**
- ✅ Admin accounts (999, 99) get full read/write access
- ✅ Regular users can view their own order history
- ✅ Fixes Order History tab loading

## 📋 **WHAT THE FIX DOES:**

### **RLS Policies Created:**

1. **`admin_full_access_logon`** - Allows admin users full access to manage all passwords
2. **`users_own_logon_access`** - Allows users to manage their own login records
3. **`admin_full_access_accounts`** - Allows admin users full access to all account records
4. **`users_own_account_access`** - Allows users to access their own account info
5. **`admin_full_access_ordhist`** - Allows admin users to view all order history
6. **`users_own_ordhist_access`** - Allows users to view their own order history

### **Security Model:**
- **Admin Users (999, 99)**: Full access to all records across all tables
- **Regular Users**: Access limited to their own records only
- **Authenticated Access**: All policies require valid JWT authentication
