# Promo Code Fix Summary - July 11, 2025

## Issue
The SAVE10 promo code was showing as "Invalid promo code" when users tried to apply it in the shopping cart, even though it appeared in the dropdown list.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by multiple factors:
1. **Row Level Security (RLS) policies** were too restrictive, preventing the validation function from accessing promo code data
2. **Database function inconsistencies** between different migration files
3. **Missing or incorrect promo code data** in the database

## Solution Applied
Created and executed migration `20250711_final_promo_code_fix.sql` which:

### 1. Fixed RLS Policies
- Dropped overly restrictive policies
- Created permissive policies for promo code validation:
  - `Enable read access for active promo codes`
  - `Enable read access for promo code usage`
  - `Enable insert for promo code usage`

### 2. Updated Database Functions
- **`check_promo_code_validity`**: Robust validation with proper error handling and case-insensitive matching
- **`get_all_promo_codes`**: Returns all available promo codes with discount calculations
- **`record_promo_code_usage`**: Properly records usage and updates remaining uses

### 3. Ensured Promo Code Data
- Guaranteed SAVE10 exists with correct configuration:
  - Code: `SAVE10`
  - Type: `percent_off`
  - Value: `10.00` (10%)
  - Min Order: `$0.00`
  - Active: `TRUE`
  - Valid from: `2024-01-01` to `2025-12-31`

### 4. Added Additional Test Codes
- **WELCOME15**: 15% off with $50 minimum (limited to 1 use per account)
- **BULK25**: $25 off with $200 minimum

## Testing Results
✅ **SAVE10 validation test**: `is_valid: true`, discount correctly calculated as 10% of order value
✅ **get_all_promo_codes test**: Returns all 3 promo codes with proper descriptions and best code flagging
✅ **RLS policies**: Functions can access data without permission errors

## Expected Behavior Now
1. Users should see SAVE10 in the promo code dropdown
2. When SAVE10 is selected and "Apply" is clicked, it should:
   - Validate successfully
   - Show "Promo code applied: 10% Off Any Order"
   - Calculate 10% discount on the order total
   - Display the discount in the cart totals

## Files Modified
- `supabase/migrations/20250711_final_promo_code_fix.sql` (new migration)

## Database Functions Updated
- `check_promo_code_validity()`
- `get_all_promo_codes()`
- `record_promo_code_usage()`

## Next Steps
The promo code system should now work correctly. If users still experience issues:
1. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify the user is logged in with a valid account number
3. Ensure the cart has items with a total value > $0
4. Check Supabase logs for any function execution errors

## Migration Applied
The migration was successfully applied to the hosted Supabase database (project: ekklokrukxmqlahtonnc) on July 11, 2025.
